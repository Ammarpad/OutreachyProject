These are some scripts that I created while working on Outreachy internship. While not part of the main Internship work they're nevertheless useful and helped me in the outreachy work as well as procedures for operating bot and the approval process.

* **update\_gnd\_id\_qualifiers.py**
	- This scripts uses Wikidata Query services to extract list of eligible items to update the qualifier. It has been approved to be run on Wikidata but is not currently, due to outstanding main Outreachy tasks. ([Approval page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Bot/AmmarBot))
* **fix\_belarusian\_desc.py**
	- This module is a one-time run script to fix a typographical error (in Belarusian language) on some few thousands of item pages.  It also uses Wikidata Query services to the get relevant pages. It's not yet approved, but approval request is pending.  ([Approval request page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Bot/AmmarBot_3))
