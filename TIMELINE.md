#### May 24 to June 5:
- Familiarize myself more with the Pywikibot package and its API as well as the existing scripts at [mikepeel/wikicode](https://bitbucket.org/mikepeel/wikicode/ ). Do extensive exploration of the code to have a deeper understanding of it before starting the coding.
- Identify broad categories of topics to work with and details of data to import.
- Outline and write detailed plan for manageable subtasks to code for and execute from start to end of the project based on the identified categories of topics.
- Fine tune details with mentor.

#### June 6 to July 4:
- Implement python modules to execute the tasks (5 modules)
- Build upon and integrate with the modules written in the Micro Tasks phase.
- Create a bot account on Wikidata and submit it for approval process [Wikidata:Bots#Approval_process](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Bots#Approval_process)
for a number of tasks to be decided.
- Do mass or chunked continuous run of the bot (time and format to be decided in the concrete outlining week)


#### July 5 to August 1:
- Write mid-point project progress blog post
- Implement python modules to execute the final batch of tasks (10 modules)
- Plan and request for bot task approval for the newly coded tasks
- Do mass or chunked continuous run of the bot (time and format to be decided in the concrete outlining week)
- Map outstanding issues in the [mikepeel/wikicode](https://bitbucket.org/mikepeel/wikicode/ ) scripts that needs addressing and outline manageable subtasks
- Fine tune details with mentor

#### August 2 to August 16:
- Refine and integrate the modules to [mikepeel/wikicode](https://bitbucket.org/mikepeel/wikicode/ )  scripts
- Work on subtasks outlined earlier with the wikicode scripts; example porting more modules to Python3, handling unhandled special cases.
- More bot run to import data

- Wrapping up, finish integrating the scripts
- Attend to any other outstanding issue/bug fix that might have remained in the course of the project.
